# design-patterns

Learning design patterns by implementing them in various programming languages.

## Creational design patterns
Creational design patterns provide us with various ways to create objects, which increase flexibility and make code more reusable.

1. [Singleton](creational/singleton)
2. [Simple factory](creational/simple-factory)
3. [Factory method](creational/factory-method)

## Structural design patterns
Structural design patterns describe how to connect objects into bigger structures to keep flexibility and efficiency.

## Behavioral design patterns
Behavioral design patterns describe how to split responsibilities between objects.

1. [Memento](behavioral/memento)
